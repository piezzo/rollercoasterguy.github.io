A ready-to-run raspberry pi image that just shows the the above url in full-screen can be obtained [here (10Mbit uplink only)](https://gofile.me/3Edfh/PbZQgWZhJ) or [here (s3 us-east)](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/piezzo-storage/images/pi_bitcoin-rollercoaster.img.gz).

# issues

* The all-time-high section is inaccurate. If you know a (free) API which serves all-time-highs with accurate dates, please tell me or make a PR.
* If it doesn't run on a smart-tv, the JavaScript in this app is probybly too complex for your outdated smart-tv's browser.
